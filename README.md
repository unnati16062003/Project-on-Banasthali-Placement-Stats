Data Analysis And Visualization of Banasthali Placement Stats
This project is a comprehensive analysis of the placement statistics of Banasthali University, including data visualization, prediction, and sentiment analysis based on the reviews provided by students.

Description
The purpose of this project is to analyze the placement statistics of Banasthali University, including data from the past few years, to provide insights into the trends and patterns of placements. The project also aims to predict the number of students who will be placed in the coming year, based on the analysis of the past data.

Furthermore, the project includes a sentiment analysis of the reviews provided by students about the placement process at Banasthali University. This analysis aims to identify the percentage of positive and negative reviews by students during the placement process and provide a clear idea to other students of placements.

Installation
To run this project, you will need the following Python packages:

pandas
matplotlib
seaborn
scikit-learn
streamlit
plotly.express
hydralit_components
streamlit-authenticator(version:0.1.5)
nltk
pymongo
numpy
we need to install these packages using pip by running the following command:

pip install pandas
pip install matplotlib
pip install seaborn
pip install sklearn
pip install streamlit
pip install plotly
pip install hydralit_components
pip install pip install streamlit-authenticator==0.1.5
pip install nltk
pip install numpy
Usage
To run this project, you can simply run the "home.py" script by using the command:
streamlit run home.py
Install the required Python packages by running the given commands in the command prompt or terminal

A HOME PAGE will displayed on screen where the user need to REGISTER first.

If he/she has already register it then LOGIN using valid login id and password.

The script will load the dataset, and users can check the Placements data by selecting their required criteria.

It will also generate visualizations to help users understand the placement data. The script will display the following visualizations:

A bargraph of the distribution of students placed in different industries yearly
A scatter plot of the number of students placed over the years
A pie chart of percentage ofnumber of students is placed in the different branches.
It will also generate predictions for the number of students who will be placed in the coming year.
The script will also perform sentiment analysis on the reviews provided by students . The sentiment analysis results will be displayed like i.e. review is positive or negative .
Overall, Data Analysis and Visualization of Banasthali Placement Stats project provides a comprehensive analysis of the placement statistics of Banasthali University, including data visualization, prediction, and sentiment analysis based on the reviews provided by students. It can be used by students, faculty, and staff to gain insights into the placement process and make data-driven decisions to improve the placement process.
